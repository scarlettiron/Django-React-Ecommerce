BARRELHOUSE
A TrueType Font by S. John Ross

Barrelhouse is another font I’ve built for work – a Uresia mini-supplement called Caravel that I’m finishing right now. Caravel is about a small wooden sailing ship with haunted sails, with little pokes into the privacy of her crew and sidebars on everything from the looms of the sea witches of Dreed to the rules for an old Uresian mariner’s drinking game. None of that make any sense? No worries; Barrelhouse carries the spirit of the thing in font form; the rest is just detail. Barrelhouse is a decorative all-caps font with a full keyboard character set.
